# C++ Sharks
This is a simple little C++ program to help myself gain some knowledge about C++ programming
For this app to work, you have to compile it
You can download this program and open terminal or cmd and compile it like so:
type 
g++ main.cpp sharks.cpp -o program (hit enter)
./program                          (hit enter)

I will be posting more C++ programs in the future, comment what C++ simple app you think I should make next... :D
